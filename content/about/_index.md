Hello, there!

I'm Luis, a NYC-based software developer. I graduated from Hunter College with a
bachelor in Computer Science back in Fall 2021, and started working in the
tech industry right after in Spring 2022.

Outside of work, I like to

* listen to music, preferably ambient/downtempo (Tycho, Bonobo, WMD, Gold Panda,
  Nujabes), vaporwave/synthwave/chillwave (HOME, A.L.I.S.O.N, Hello
  Meteor), etc.

* read, preferably science-related books and biographies. I also read manga.

* do woodworking. This is a recent hobby, and I'm still learning how to sharpen
  my carving knives.
