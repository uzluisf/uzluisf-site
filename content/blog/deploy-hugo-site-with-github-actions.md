# Two Repositories

* `uzluisf/uzluisf-site` -- stores the site's source code that will be used to
  generate the HTML with Hugo. We'll call this the source repository.

* `uzluisf/uzluisf.github.io` -- stores the HTML which is served through Github
  Pages. I'm using the domain provided by Github. We'll call this the target
  repository.
