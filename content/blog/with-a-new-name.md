Back on October 2019, the programming language formerly known as Perl 6 was
officially renamed to Raku. With the rename many things needed to be updated to
match the language's shiny new name (e.g., executables, extensions,
documentation, etc.) and this included the Spanish translation of Laurent
Rosenfeld's [*Think Raku*](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-perl-6/), an
introduction to Computer Science and programming using Raku.

The Spanish translation is titled *Piensa en Raku* and can be found at
